Hi, I’m Dario Di Palma, a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at [Politecnico di Bari](https://www.poliba.it/), Italy, under the guidance of Professor [Tommaso Di Noia](https://sisinflab.poliba.it/people/tommaso-di-noia/). I hold both Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Bari, where I developed a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Recommender Systems.

My research focuses on integrating Large Language Models and Recommender Systems, culminating in the development of a pioneering example: [Recommender-ChatGPT](https://github.com/sisinflab/Recommender-ChatGPT). I specialize in interpretability techniques to explore LLM latent spaces and develop [multi-objective evaluation frameworks](https://github.com/sisinflab/RecMOE) for RS to address diverse user and system needs. I am set to graduate in January 2026.
