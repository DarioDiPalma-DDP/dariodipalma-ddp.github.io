Hi, I’m Dario Di Palma, a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at [Politecnico di Bari](https://www.poliba.it/), Italy, under the supervision of Professor [Tommaso Di Noia](https://sisinflab.poliba.it/people/tommaso-di-noia/). I hold both a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Bari, where I developed a strong foundation in AI and Recommender Systems, which continues to shape my research today.

I am a final-year Ph.D. student, set to graduate in January 2026, with a research focus on bridging the worlds of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Recommender Systems (RS). My work explores interpretability techniques for understanding latent spaces in LLMs, alongside advancing multi-objective evaluation frameworks for recommender systems to address diverse user and system needs.
