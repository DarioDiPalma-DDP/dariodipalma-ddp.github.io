## Project Overview

This project presents a Python-based interpreter for the Go programming language, developed as part of a Master's thesis. The interpreter is designed to parse and execute Go code, providing insights into language interpretation and compiler construction.

## Features

- **Go Language Parsing**: Implements a parser capable of understanding Go syntax and semantics.
- **Code Execution**: Executes Go code by interpreting the parsed abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **Educational Resource**: Serves as a learning tool for those interested in language interpreters and the Go language.

## Usage

To explore and utilize the Go interpreter:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DarioDiPalma-DDP/Go-Interpreter-In-Python.git
   ```
2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed. Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Interpreter**:
   Execute the main script to start the interpreter:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   You can then input Go code to be interpreted.

## Dependencies

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or later
- **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)**: For lexical analysis and parsing
