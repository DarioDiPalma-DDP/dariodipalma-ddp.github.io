## Project Overview

This high school thesis, completed in 2017, delves into the principles of electromagnetic waves and their utilization in daily life. A significant component of the project involved constructing a device capable of recording and retransmitting the signals employed in automobile locking and unlocking systems.

## Features

- **Electromagnetic Wave Analysis**: Investigated the properties and behaviors of electromagnetic waves.
- **Practical Application**: Developed a device to capture and resend signals from car key fobs, demonstrating real-world applications of theoretical concepts.
- **Hardware Integration**: Utilized RF transmitter and receiver modules operating at 433 MHz, integrated with an external 2.0 sound card for signal processing.

## Device Components

- **433 MHz RF Transmitter Module**: Used for sending recorded signals.
- **433 MHz RF Receiver Module**: Employed to capture signals from car key fobs.
- **External 2.0 Sound Card**: Facilitated the recording and playback of signals through the RF modules.
